            "Description": "Finally had a chance to speak Jodi Scranton.  She is the IT Manager-Ron Lewis's (owners) assistant for the past 16 years and she loves it!!  She told me that she will be working here until retirement.  It is a family owned business for the past 45 years and the owner Ron still comes in every morning to work.  So they have been with Autosoft for the past 8 years and they have 3 Chrysler franchises and each has it's own server, 1 pre-own store that is run under Chrysler, Chevy-Kia store that also has it's own server and a Ford franchise that also has it's own server.  They own their servers and do not use centralized accounting because each store is a stand alone store and that is the way they want it run.  The corporate controller is Diane who actually will be making the final call but there will be also other people involved including herself.  She is definitely interested in seeing what we have.  This is how it works she wants an e-mail form you  seeing a visual of all 3 products (systems Dash-Drive and Drive XL and what it covers also she would like info on our CRM since they are suing Traffic Cop.  She wants to see what is compatible and of course talk to you about price and discounts with the type of franchises they have.  Once she receives that she will review and wants to set up a time to talk then she presents it to Diane who will want to see a demo then all people will be involved but initially it goes through Jodi first.  They do use CDK's website for their Chevy store.  Also Chevy offer a DIT app which they utilize at each locations, basically it is a web filtering and firewall protection which they love.  I asked her if she had any issues with Autosoft and she laughed telling me, \" let's start by getting the info I asked for from the rep  because there are issues.  Great opportunity for a 6 store unhook!!! Please e-mail her today with what she has asked for, it will take her a couple days to respond since her mom went into the hospital yesterday she will be leaving early but still looking at e-mails .  Her e-mail is jscranton@ronlewisautomotive.com she could be contacted at 724-846-1440.  Thank you",

They are working with someone to help implement a BDC/process and they are not happy. They would like to work with Traver. He asked many questions like, how soon before we could be up and running? Which package is best for my store? Can we work out deals with pricing since he has other non-GM stores? He would also like to include service in this process at some point. Can we work out a deal on bootcamp, depending upon the number of people I bring? (Ron that question is directed to you). He is very anxious to get his store up and running and needs to convince his dealer of the same. He can be reached at 412-469-2100 ext. 1916. I will add this lead to Salesforce. Good luck! \r\n\r\nIt might be a good idea to connect with Ron before making this call, since there are so many questions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nLaKesha Carter\r\nExecutive Administrative Assistant\r\nTraver Technologies\r\n2550 Gray Falls Drive, Suite 400\r\nHouston, Texas 77077\r\nDirect: 281.886.1480\r\nOffice: 281.752.6262\r\nToll Free: 800.929.8478\r\nFax: 281.556.5400\r\nE-mail: lakesha.carter@adp.com\r\nhttp://www.travertech.com \r\n\r\n“Change is inevitable, growth is intentional” Glenda Cloud",
